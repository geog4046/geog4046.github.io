  <h1 class="text-center">Lesson 1 Web Page Basics - Intro to web pages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h1>
  <p>Terms: code, web browser, web page, content</p>

<p>This is a Web GIS beginner’s guide to web pages. The information in this lesson is the foundation for understanding how web pages work and how to code your own web maps. The focus will be on the three computer languages used in web pages—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—and how web browsers interpret these languages to display a web page.</p>

<p>The goal of this lesson is to give enough background on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would be able to follow a basic guide to Web GIS JavaScript libraries offered by <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial">Google</a>, <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/create-a-starter-app/">Esri</a>, <a href="https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/">Leaflet</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/geog4046/geog4046.github.io/wiki/Web-GIS-Examples#getting-started-tutorials">others</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Your goal should be to understand the concepts, not try to memorize code.</strong></p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Web pages are documents containing information in the form of text, maps, images, and other media. This is often described as “content”. Web page documents are displayed in a web browser to deliver content to the audience. The browser reads the source code of the document and displays the output to the user. The output is a rendered version of the document, meaning the browser interprets the source code to determine how to display the document, e.g., what font color and size or where to show an image. The “code” can be considered a set of written instructions for the browser to follow.</p>

<p> <br />

<small><em>Figure 1. The job of the web browser is to retrieve a document from a URL, interpret the document’s code, and display the rendered web page in the browser window for the user to see, including all linked images, videos, and other media.</em></small></p>

<h2 id="web-browsers-and-web-pages">Web Browsers and Web Pages</h2>

<p>If you are reading this lesson, you might not have much experience with creating web page documents from scratch, but there is another type of document that you have probably created many times: a Word document. To understand how web pages and browsers work, let’s first look at how a browser is similar to a word processor, Microsoft Word.<br />
<img src="../../notes/images/word-docx.png" alt="Word document icon" /></p>

<p>You can follow along by <a href="https://lsu.box.com/shared/static/w50mzz6jj82kj0ds4ge1himhgnqg9n5h.docx">downloading the example document</a>.</p>

<p>Opening the file in Word shows a rendered document with formatted text “This is a Word document” and an image of a map.</p>

<p> <br />
<img src="../../notes/images/word-docx-rendered.png" alt="Screenshot of a rendered Word document showing formatted text and an image" /><br />
<small><em>Figure 2. A document rendered by Microsoft Word. The way that a word processing program renders a document is similar to how a browser renders a web page.</em></small></p>

<p>Now let’s look behind the scenes in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">docx</code> file. If you rename the file from <code class="highlighter-rouge">New Document.docx</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">New Document.zip</code> in Windows File Explorer, you can open the zip file like a folder and see that the Word document is actually a collection of files and folders.<br />
<img src="../../notes/images/word-docx-zip.png" alt="Word document renamed as a zip file" /></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>_rels
docProps
word
[Content_Types].xml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In <code class="highlighter-rouge">New Document.zip</code>, browse into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">word</code> folder. These files contain the code that tells Word how to display the document with the correct content (fonts, colors, graphics, etc.). Find <code class="highlighter-rouge">document.xml</code> and open it with Internet Explorer. The highlights in the screenshot show some recognizable text within the code—“This is a Word document”, a color code to make “Word” red, and a reference to the map image file.</p>

<p> <br />
<img src="../../notes/images/word-code.png" alt="XML of a Word document" /><br />
<small><em>Figure 3. This document is written in a language called XML. It is a file included in a Microsoft Word document that tells the program how to display the document.</em></small></p>

<p>Note that the map image is stored in a file separate from <code class="highlighter-rouge">document.xml</code>, which has a piece of code that points to the image file. Therefore, Word will read <code class="highlighter-rouge">document.xml</code> for instructions for how to display the document, and when it gets to the code pointing to the image, Word will look for the image file and display it within the document. In this example, the image is referenced with its original file name <code class="highlighter-rouge">map.png</code>. We can find this image file in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">word\media</code> folder, renamed to <code class="highlighter-rouge">image1.png</code>.</p>

<p>The word processor’s job is to assemble and make sense of all of those different files and folders in order to display the content to the user. This is basically how a web browser works when it assembles the various web pages and graphics that make a website. Instead of opening a document file saved on your computer, the web browser usually opens a document online via a URL.</p>

<h2 id="urls-and-files">URLs and files</h2>
<p>The URL is an address to another computer on the Internet, a web server, and to a specific document on that web server, for example <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://example.com/index.html</code>. The document in this case is called <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>, and it contains the code that the browser will use to display the text, download and display images, and follow any other instructions needed to correctly display the web page.</p>

<p>If you omit the file name from the URL, the web server will assume you want the default document, which is often <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>. Therefore:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">https://example.com</code><br />
is the same as:<br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">https://example.com/index.html</code></p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">.html</code> refers to Hypertext Markup Language, one of the main languages that browsers use to interpret web page documents. The two other languages are CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<h2 id="html-css-and-javascript">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h2>
<p>While there are many computer languages used to generate web pages and applications on web servers, only three languages are used to deliver the web page to the browser:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong> gives the browser information about the content and what resources to download, e.g., images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.</li>
  <li><strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> contain rules for how web page content should be presented, such as fonts and colors.</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript (JS)</strong> is a programming language that allows us to give instructions for how the browser should react to certain events, such as a click.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, HTML, CSS, and JS are the content, style, and behavior of a web page.</p>

<p>The three languages are often embodied in the website as three separate files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> (standard file name)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">something.css</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">something.js</code></li>
</ul>

<p>They are linked together through the HTML file, which contains special elements, <code class="highlighter-rouge">link</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">script</code>, which refer to the CSS and JavaScript, respectively. When a browser reads your web page’s HTML, it will enounter these tags and download the files they reference, giving the browser additional instructions on how the web page should look and act.</p>

<p> <br />
<img src="../../assignment-resources/images/files-html-css-js.png" alt="HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files" /><br />
<small><em>Figure 4. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">link</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">script</code> tags allow you to specify CSS and JavaScript files to include with your HTML.</em></small></p>

<p>Specifically for web maps, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript each serve roles in displaying a web map on a web page.</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML: create an “invisible box” that will be like a canvas on which the map is drawn.</li>
  <li>CSS: set the dimensions of the box to control the size of the map on the screen, as well as the appearance of popups and other visual components of the map.</li>
  <li>JS: Retrieve data from web services, draw layers on the map canvas (in the HTML), listen for user clicks, zooms, pans, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p> <br />
<img src="../../assignment-resources/images/roles-html-css-js.png" alt="The roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a web map" /><br />
<small><em>Figure 5. The roles that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in displaying a map on a web page.</em></small></p>

<p>In terms of how those roles translate into code in each HTML, CSS, and JS file, each map displayed on the web page has a unique <code class="highlighter-rouge">id</code> that is referenced in the HTML, CSS, and JS to work together to control the appearance and behavior of the map.</p>

<p> <br />
<img src="../../assignment-resources/images/id-id-id.png" alt="HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code using the same ID" /><br />
<small><em>Figure 6. The same <code class="highlighter-rouge">id</code> will be used to identify the map in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">id</code> is a unique name that you create.</em></small></p>

<p>All three components are needed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Without the HTML, there would be no <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code> element to draw the map in.</li>
  <li>Without the CSS, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code> could exist in the HTML, but it would not have a height, and would therefore be invisible.</li>
  <li>Without the JS, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code> could exist in the HTML with a height specified in the CSS, but there would be no map because the layers weren’t retrieved and drawn on the map, and users could not click or scroll on the map.</li>
</ul>

<p>The browser reads the three languages and combines the instructions to create a seamless web page that hides the complexities behind the scenes.</p>

<p><small>Note: it is possible to put CSS into an HTML file directly with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">style</code> tag, and JavaScript can be written between <code class="highlighter-rouge">script</code> tags in and HTML file. Doing so would leave you with a single <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> and no separate <code class="highlighter-rouge">.css</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">.js</code> files. However, in our assignments, we will always put scripts and styles in separate files, meaning each assigment will have an <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>, a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.css</code> file, and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.js</code> file.</small></p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A web browser opens a web page via a URL and renders the content on screen. The web browser reads the web page’s source code for instructions on how to display the web page and react to user interactions, such as mouse clicks. The next lessons on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will focus on understanding and writing source code, in preparation for developing our own web maps.</p>
