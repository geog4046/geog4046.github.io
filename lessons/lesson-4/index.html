<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The previous lesson covered general concepts that apply not only to Web GIS but the web in general. We will now focus on the components of a typical web-based geographic information system. It is a peek under the hood of the Web GIS machine so that when you build web maps later or encounter them outside of this course you will have a basic understanding of how it all works.</p>

<p><strong>Keep in mind that architectures and specific configurations will change as Web GIS evolves. The technical details provided in this lesson should be taken as tangible examples of recent and current practices, not inherent characteristics of Web GIS.</strong></p>

<h2 id="servers-and-the-cloud">Servers and the cloud</h2>
<p>Since the terms “server” and “application” were prominent in Part 1 of this lesson, let us look closer at what they are, where they are, and what they do.</p>

<p>Put simply, <strong>servers</strong> are computers and software that provide (serve) resources to other computers. The computers and software that request and receive resources from servers are <strong>clients</strong>. Any computer can be a client; a server can act as a client if it is consuming resources from another server. In turn, any computer can be a server—you could configure a laptop as a web server if you wanted to—but in practice, servers are built with specialized hardware meant for high performance and constant use.</p>

<p>Servers are typically kept in a <strong>data center</strong> with adequate cooling, fire protection, redundant power, and physical security. Data centers are often located in places geographically close to the intended audience to improve speeds. Amazon has AWS data centers concentrated on the east and west coasts of North America and across Europe and East Asia, but isolated data centers in smaller markets in Africa, Australia, and South America.</p>

<small><em>Figure 2. Racks of servers in a Google data center in Oklahoma. <a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/gallery/">Source</a>.</em></small></p>

<p>If you visit the website <a href="https://atlas.ga.lsu.edu">https://atlas.ga.lsu.edu</a>, your web browser’s request is routed through the Internet to one of the servers pictured in Figure 1. The web application installed on the server responds with the webpage. Similarly, when you perform a Google search, your request is routed to applications running on servers in Google’s data centers.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, the applications on these servers are more complex than the typical programs installed on your personal computer, usually involving virtual machines and configurations that distribute applications across multiple servers and even multiple data centers in different cities, countries, or continents. This is <strong>cloud computing</strong>, where applications are not installed directly on a single hardware device, but instead run on networked computers working in cooperation. From our client perspective, it just works. On the server, however, processing and storage capacity are being dynamically routed based on which applications are busy and which are not. If an application suddenly receives a lot of traffic, a cloud infrastructure can spread the application across more servers to handle the increased load. Likewise, cloud-based applications that stretch across multiple data centers can route traffic from users in North America to data centers in North America, users in Asia to data centers in Asia, and so on.</p>

<p>To set up any Web GIS infrastructure, you could either buy your own server hardware and house it on-premises in your organization’s data center, or use Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure, which both give access to servers to install Web GIS applications. The decision to use an on-premises or IaaS solution should be made based on the costs of maintaining everything yourself versus the costs of paying a third-party service. This varies by organization, depending on existing facilities (do you already have a data center?), expertise (do you already have IT staff?), and other organizational requirements.</p>

<p>For this course we will use ArcGIS Online, a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution that does not involve maintaining our own hardware or even installing our own software. With SaaS, those matters are taken care of; you simply sign into a website and use the provided web applications. Even if you are not familiar with the term, you probably use SaaS often, such as Microsoft Office 365 with your university email.</p>

<p>For most Web GIS users, the specifics of cloud computing and server architecture are of little consequence. They can simply sign into the ArcGIS Online website, for example, and start making maps. Nonetheless, the diagrams below should give an idea of some of the applications involved if you were to configure your own Web GIS servers.</p>

<p>Recall the client-server model, where a client (web browser) downloads a webpage from a web server. For a simple webpage like <a href="https://atlas.ga.lsu.edu">https://atlas.ga.lsu.edu</a> with no web maps, the diagram has only the client and the server (Figure 3).</p>

<p> <br />
<img src="../../lessons/images/atlas-server-client.png" alt="Atlas website server and client" class="no-shadow" /><br />
<small><em>Figure 3. A client web browser requests the website <a href="https://atlas.ga.lsu.edu">https://atlas.ga.lsu.edu</a> and the server responds with the homepage.</em></small></p>

<p>Think about how the diagram might change with Web GIS using web services, based on what we have covered so far regarding web services. If you display your data and maps on your own website, but have also opened up your map data for public use through web services, it is possible that users will not use your website to view your data. Instead, they may find a third-party app that takes advantage of your web services to provide the data.</p>

<p> <br />

<small><em>Figure 4. “Your” Web GIS providing public web services in addition to a website. If third parties take advantage of the web services, then the audience will have a choice in how to use your data, either through your own website or a different site/app.</em></small></p>

<p>The next figure shows this concept in action. Atlas is a website to download GIS datasets for Louisiana, and it offers some of those datasets as web services as well. A web service for high-resolution imagery of towns in Richland Parish is used by a third-party website for local government.</p>

<p> <br />

<small><em>Figure 5. A web service being used by two websites. The web service for 3-inch aerial imagery of towns in Richland Parish is consumed by the Atlas website and the Richland Parish Assessor’s Office website. If an update is made to the web service, the change will be automatically reflected in any website/app using the service.</em></small></p>

<h2 id="web-gis-servers">Web GIS servers</h2>

<p>If we focus on the Web GIS component of the previous figures in more detail, it can be broken down into three servers or applications. The figure below illustrates a typical Web GIS configuration with three servers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web server - listens for requests from clients and sends responses</li>
  <li>GIS server - runs web services that provide the data used in maps</li>
  <li>Data store - holds files and databases containing the data that is served through the GIS server’s web services</li>
</ul>

<p>These three applications could be installed on the same server (typically in Windows or Linux) or on separate servers. Regardless, communication flows from web server to GIS server to data store, then back from data store to GIS server to web server.</p>

<p> <br />
<img src="../../lessons/images/webgis-3-servers.png" alt="Web GIS architecture with three servers" class="no-shadow" /><br />
<small><em>Figure 6. A Web GIS infrastructure with three servers. The web server communicates with public clients and the internal GIS server, which hosts web services. These web services pull their data from the data store.</em></small></p>

<p>Requests from clients on the web go to the web server, which acts as a gateway and determines what needs to be sent back to clients in the response (e.g., a state boundary layer, a satellite imagery layer, etc.). Based on this determination, the web server will query the web services on the GIS server. The GIS server can then pull the appropriate data from the data store (e.g., if the requested map view is zoomed to a small area, only send the satellite images covering that specific area). From there, the requested data is sent back up the chain, from the data store to the GIS server on to the web server and ultimately to the client. The diagram shows arrows pointing in both directions, indicating that data can flow in and out of the system; clients may be able to upload new data as well as download.</p>

<p>It should be noted that a system might include more servers to handle more traffic or more computing power. For example, an additional GIS server could be added to handle requests for data analysis while the first server continues to handle requests for data layers.</p>

<p>To demonstrate what a request to a Web GIS server looks like in practice, the figure below shows data layers requested when viewing the lidar elevation map at <a href="https://maps.ga.lsu.edu/lidar2000">https://maps.ga.lsu.edu/lidar2000</a>. There is a layer of gridlines representing the footprint of each lidar image on the map, a parish boundary layer, and the lidar imagery layer. These three layers are pulled from the data store and transmitted through GIS server’s web services and the web server to the client’s web browser for display.</p>

<p> <br />
<img src="../../lessons/images/atlas-webgis-components.png" alt="Server components involved in providing a web map" class="no-shadow" /><br />
<small><em>Figure 7. Server components (green) involved in providing a web map on <a href="https://maps.ga.lsu.edu/lidar2000">https://maps.ga.lsu.edu/lidar2000</a>. Client web browsers (orange) request the webpage containing the map, the web server relays the request to the GIS server, and the GIS server figures out which data layers are needed from the data store. The response is passed back through the web server to the client, where the web browser assembles the text, graphics, etc. to display the map.</em></small></p>

<h2 id="web-gis-software">Web GIS software</h2>

<p>The figures below show the names of specific applications that can be used to build a Web GIS.</p>

<p>ArcGIS Enterprise is a set of applications that you can install on your own servers to essentially reproduce the functionality of ArcGIS Online, which we will use in this course. The web server application (Portal) runs the website interface that users interact with, ArcGIS Server hosts web services for map layers, and Data Store manages the database containing the data behind the web services.</p>

<p> <br />
<img src="../../lessons/images/arcgis-webgis.png" alt="ArcGIS suite for Web GIS" class="no-shadow" /><br />
<small><em>Figure 8. The ArcGIS software suite for Web GIS, known as ArcGIS Enterprise, includes ArcGIS Data Store, Server, and Portal. It can use the Windows web server, IIS. ArcGIS icons from “Getting to Know Web GIS, 3rd Edition”.</em></small></p>

<p>Following the same web server, GIS server, and data store model, a free open-source software stack can be used to create web services. Installing GeoServer will install a web server application (Jetty) and the GeoServer GIS server, which can then connect to an open-source database such as PostgreSQL.</p>

<p> <br />

<small><em>Figure 9. Free, open-source software can work together to build a Web GIS, namely Jetty web server, GeoServer GIS server, and PostgreSQL database.</em></small></p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In current practice, web-based geographic information systems generally consist of three major components: a data store, a GIS server application, and a web server. These core components can deliver data via web services to internal websites and apps, or to third parties.</p>

<p>Web GIS software can be set up in a variety of environments, from a computer in your office to a globally distributed cloud computing network. Regardless of specific software and hardware configurations, at least one characteristic of Web GIS is likely to endure as the technology evolves: web services. The ability to link applications and share data layers makes web services a valuable component of Web GIS.</p>
