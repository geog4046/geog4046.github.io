              This page shows heading text and paragraph text inside of a div
              with a blue background, which is inside of a div with a green
              background, which is inside of a div with a red background, which
              is inside of a div with no background defined and a width of 400
              pixels. All of the divs have a black border 5 pixels thick with 20
              pixels of padding on the inside of the border (that's why this text
              doesn't extend all the way to the border, and why the borders of
              the divs don't touch each other). The heights of all the divs are
              determined by the amount of text here in the inner-most div as well
              as the amount of accumulated padding and border thickness.
