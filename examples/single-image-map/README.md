# Example: Single-image basemap
- Create a map with a custom coordinate reference system
- Display a basemap consisting of a single image file.
- There is no tiling involved, so the entire image file will be downloaded when a user visits the page. Therefore, the file size of the image needs to be considered when using this method.
